Internationalisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Joyous now supports multiple languages.  Thanks to Dylan Ferris for the work on
the internationalization of Joyous and creating the French translation.

Heureux heureux, joie joie.

CSS
~~~
.page-index .item-heading has been changed to .page-index strong, and
.event-index .item-heading has been changed to .event-index strong

base.html
~~~~~~~~~
Joyous no longer needs a customised base.html with "global_css" and
"background" blocks.  The joyous.css is included in the "extra_css" block, and 
the HTML required for popups on the calendar pages are generated dynamically
by Javascript.
